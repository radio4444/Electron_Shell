# Project 2 - *Electron Shell*

**Electron Shell** is a program, where the user can find the number of electron on each shell: K,L,M,N,O,P,Q

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following things are in the electron shell:

- [x] The user would able to enter one of the shells: K,L,M,N,O,P,Q
- [x] After the user enter one of the shells, it will tell them the answer and they have to re-run the program to learn others. 
- [x] If the user input other than "K,L,M,N,O,P,Q", then it will give error message: Error! Re-run the program to try again. 


## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

There is a 2 minutes and 19 seconds of video attach to this project

## Notes
I would say, I did not struggle creating this program, after I learn what my professor want for the input and output of this prograam. Right now, I basically use calculation manually instead of computing the number of electronns in shell can hold in the program.
In future, I would use for loops, arrays and operation to make it more simple code reading and not repetative.
